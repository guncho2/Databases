Use the commands we have learned about to complete the following tasks and submit the SQL statements 
in the submission tab. Real world examples must be distinct from those used in the text.

List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data

INSERT INTO to add 
UPDATE to upadate
DELETE FROM to delete



Explain the structure for each type of command.

INSERT INTO then the name of the table, the columns name between parenthesis, and then the VALUE word and the 
values between parenthesis.
INSERT INTO 'table name' (columns, columns) VALUES (values, values);

UPDATE then name of your table and the SET with the column you want to change and WHERE id is equal to certain row.
UPDATE 'table name' SET 'column name' WHERE id=

DELETE FROM the name of the table, WHERE id= or row or piece of data to delete

What are some the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real world example of each.

Money. price of any product in a shopping car
Date. Date of any event 
Text. Names in text 
Timestamp. Time of any event where the product or item was added or modified.

4) Think through how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding. This table needs to have 
first and last name, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of 
meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).


Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?

First and last name. text
Whether they sent in their RSVP. boolean
Number of guests. smallint
Number of meals.smallint

5) Write a command that makes the table to track the wedding.

library=# CREATE TABLE wedding(id integer, firstname text, rsvp boolean, numberofguests smallint, numberofmeals smallint);

library=# SELECT * FROM wedding;
 id | firstname | rsvp | numberofguests | numberofmeals 
----+-----------+------+----------------+---------------
(0 rows)

Using the table we just created, write a command that adds a column to track whether they were sent a thank you card.

library=# ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thankyoucard boolean;

library=# SELECT * FROM wedding;
 id | firstname | rsvp | numberofguests | numberofmeals | thankyoucard 
----+-----------+------+----------------+---------------+--------------
(0 rows)


You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing 
the number meals from the wedding table.

library=# ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN numberofmeals;

library=# SELECT * FROM wedding; 
 id | firstname | rsvp | numberofguests | thankyoucard 
----+-----------+------+----------------+--------------
(0 rows)



The guests are going to need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds 
a column for table number.

library=# ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN tablenumber smallint;
ALTER TABLE

library=# SELECT * FROM wedding;
 id | firstname | rsvp | numberofguests | thankyoucard | tablenumber 
----+-----------+------+----------------+--------------+-------------
(0 rows)


The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that
deletes the wedding table from the database.


DROP TABLE wedding;

SELECT * FROM wedding;
ERROR:  relation "wedding" does not exist


5) Write a command to make a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date
number of copies, and available copies.

CREATE TABLE books(id integer, isbn varchar(15), title text, author text, genre text,
 publishing_date date, numberof_copies smallint, available_copies smallint);


Find three books and add their information to the table.

library=# INSERT INTO books(id, isbn, title, author, genre, publishing_date, numberof_copies, available_copies) VALUES (1, 978038554418499, 'The firm', 'John GrishaM', 'Suspense', '1991-10-19', 5, 4);
INSERT 0 1

library=# SELECT * FROM books;
 id |      isbn       |  title   |    author    |  genre   | publishing_date | numberof_copies | available_copies 
----+-----------------+----------+--------------+----------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------
  1 | 978038554418499 | The firm | John GrishaM | Suspense | 1991-10-19      |               5 |                4
(1 row)

INSERT INTO books(id, isbn, title, author, genre, publishing_date, numberof_copies,
 available_copies) VALUES (2, 855429938122019, 'Looking for Jane', 'John Grisham', 'Suspense', '1989-09-11', 6, 2), (3, 855429990289381, 'Mr Walls', 'John Grisham', 'Suspense', '2001-03-09', 2, 4);
INSERT 0 2
library=# SELECT * FROM books;
 id |      isbn       |      title       |    author    |  genre   | publishing_date | numberof_copies | available_copies 
----+-----------------+------------------+--------------+----------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------
  1 | 978038554418499 | The firm         | John GrishaM | Suspense | 1991-10-19      |               5 |                4
  2 | 855429938122019 | Looking for Jane | John Grisham | Suspense | 1989-09-11      |               6 |                2
  3 | 855429990289381 | Mr Walls         | John Grisham | Suspense | 2001-03-09      |               2 |                4
(3 rows)



Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the available copies column to 1 fewer.


library=# UPDATE books SET available_copies=3 WHERE id=1;

UPDATE 1
library=# SELECT * FROM books;
 id |      isbn       |      title       |    author    |  genre   | publishing_date | numberof_copies | available_copies 
----+-----------------+------------------+--------------+----------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------
  1 | 978038554418499 | The firm         | John GrishaM | Suspense | 1991-10-19      |               5 |                3
  2 | 855429938122019 | Looking for Jane | John Grisham | Suspense | 1989-09-11      |               6 |                2
  3 | 855429990289381 | Mr Walls         | John Grisham | Suspense | 2001-03-09      |               2 |                4
(3 rows)



Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

library=# DELETE FROM books WHERE id=2;
DELETE 1
library=# SELECT * FROM books;
 id |      isbn       |  title   |    author    |  genre   | publishing_date | numberof_copies | available_copies 
----+-----------------+----------+--------------+----------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------
  1 | 978038554418499 | The firm | John GrishaM | Suspense | 1991-10-19      |               5 |                3
  3 | 855429990289381 | Mr Walls | John Grisham | Suspense | 2001-03-09      |               2 |                4
(2 rows)


6) Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, 

country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and approximate
 miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

library=# CREATE TABLE spacecrafts(id integer, name text, year varchar(4), country text, mission text, orbiting_body text, operational boolean, distance_from_earth bigint);
CREATE TABLE
library=# SELECT * FROM spacecrafts;                                                                                  
 id | name | year | country | mission | orbiting_body | operational | distance_from_earth 
----+------+------+---------+---------+---------------+-------------+---------------------
(0 rows)


Add 3 non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

library=# INSERT INTO spacecrafts(id, name, year, country, mission, orbiting_body, operational, distance_from_earth) VALUES 
        (1, 'Delta', 1982, 'USA', 'Agricultural', 'Earth', true, 87000),
        (2, 'Alpha', 1999, 'USA', 'CellPhone', 'Earth', true, 34000),
        (3, 'Spazzio', 2013, 'Europe', 'Earth', 'Maritime Signal', false, 27000);
INSERT 0 3


library=# SELECT * FROM spacecrafts;
 id |  name   | year | country |   mission    |  orbiting_body  | operational | distance_from_earth 
----+---------+------+---------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+---------------------
  1 | Delta   | 1982 | USA     | Agricultural | Earth           | t           |               87000
  2 | Alpha   | 1999 | USA     | CellPhone    | Earth           | t           |               34000
  3 | Spazzio | 2013 | Europe  | Earth        | Maritime Signal | f           |               27000
(3 rows)



Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just been crashed into the planet.


library=# DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=2;
DELETE 1
library=# SELECT * FROM spacecrafts;
 id |  name   | year | country |   mission    |  orbiting_body  | operational | distance_from_earth 
----+---------+------+---------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+---------------------
  1 | Delta   | 1982 | USA     | Agricultural | Earth           | t           |               87000
  3 | Spazzio | 2013 | Europe  | Earth        | Maritime Signal | f           |               27000
(2 rows)

Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

library=# UPDATE spacecrafts SET Operational=false WHERE id=1;
UPDATE 1
library=# SELECT * FROM spacecrafts;
 id |  name   | year | country |   mission    |  orbiting_body  | operational | distance_from_earth 
----+---------+------+---------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+---------------------
  3 | Spazzio | 2013 | Europe  | Earth        | Maritime Signal | f           |               27000
  1 | Delta   | 1982 | USA     | Agricultural | Earth           | f           |               87000
(2 rows)




7) Write a command to make a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject 
line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not it’s been read, 
and the id of the email chain it’s in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

inventory=# CREATE TABLE emails(id integer, subject text, sender text, additional_recipients text, body text, time_stamp timestamp, read boolean, email_chainid varchar(2));
CREATE TABLE
inventory=# SELECT * FROM emails;
 id | subject | sender | additional_recipients | body | time_stamp | read | email_chainid 
----+---------+--------+-----------------------+------+------------+------+---------------
(0 rows)


Add 3 new emails to the inbox.

inventory=# INSERT INTO emails(id, subject, sender, additional_recipients, body, time_stamp, read, email_chainid) VALUES
(1, 'University', 'info@University.com', 'edu@tot.com', 'Attached your notes', '2019-10-14 03:14:07', True, 1), 
(2, 'Hospital', 'info@hospital.com', 'edu@health.com', 'Health Insurance', '2019-10-12 09:32:09', True, 3),
(3, 'New Investments', 'info@bank.com', 'edu@fianan.com', 'Commodities', '2019-10-11 12:32:34', False, 9);
INSERT 0 3




You’ve just deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

DELETE FROM emails WHERE id=1;

DELETE 1
inventory=# SELECT * FROM emails;
 id |     subject     |      sender       | additional_recipients |       body       |     time_stamp      | read | email_chainid 
----+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------+---------------
  2 | Hospital        | info@hospital.com | edu@health.com        | Health Insurance | 2019-10-12 09:32:09 | t    | 3
  3 | New Investments | info@bank.com     | edu@fianan.com        | Commodities      | 2019-10-11 12:32:34 | f    | 9
(2 rows)




You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating, 
so you can come back to it later.


UPDATE emails SET Read=False WHERE id=2;

id |     subject     |      sender       | additional_recipients |       body       |     time_stamp      | read | email_chainid 
----+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------+---------------
  3 | New Investments | info@bank.com     | edu@fianan.com        | Commodities      | 2019-10-11 12:32:34 | f    | 9
  2 | Hospital        | info@hospital.com | edu@health.com        | Health Insurance | 2019-10-12 09:32:09 | f    | 3
