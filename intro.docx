Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL store data in sql format creating them in tables, where can be used modifing or retrieving data from those
tables where those tables can be linked together. It is not a programming language like javascript to create an application 
SQL is a language just to add or retrieve the data from an application. To make change and store the data we need a database 
we cant make changes every time we need to a variable or array content.

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

The high level in a SQL allow process two transaction of databases at the same time having their own isolation.
Each piece of data can be stored, modified or deleted at the same time as another equally in datat type with not need to
wait for processes. Thats one of the advantage of SQL.
